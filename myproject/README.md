# Data Ingestion and Display PoC

## Task
An example file of people data can be found in the `data` directory. The task is to 
create a Proof of Concept web application according to the following user journeys:
- User can upload a data file to the application. The data will be stored in the tool's database.
- User can view data that has been uploaded to the tool.
- User can view relevant visualisation(s) of the data that has been uploaded.

You do not have to use the scaffolding within this repository - it is optional, but
intended to remove some of the initial setup required.

Please fork this repository, add your solution as a PR in your
forked repo, and give `cyramic` and `christina-moore` read access.

## Expectations
We do not expect a fully featured and polished web application at the end of this task.
The aim is to see how you approach problems, what elements you consider, and how you
evaluate your own work. **Please do not spend more than a few hours completing this task.**

We do not expect/enforce the use of specific technologies or approaches - choose what
feels appropriate. For example, in this repository [poetry](https://python-poetry.org/) is used for package management.
It is not a requirement to use it.

We expect that you will be able to talk us through your approach to this solution and that
you will be able to provide context around it to both a technical and non-technical audience.
